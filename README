This example code is optimized for the SK6812 and WS2812B, so it transmits the colors in green-red-blue order.

If you have a WS2811 LED or a high-speed TM1804 LED strip, please note that its red and green channels are swapped relative to the SK6812 and WS2812B, so you will need to swap those channels in your code.  You might prefer to use the version of this code from commit 96bee54 (committed on 2013-10-10), which does not require you to swap red and green.

This version of the code does NOT work with the older, low-speed TM1804 strips (items #2540, #2541, and #2542).  If you have one of those, you should use the version of this code from commit edc9e9d (committed on 2013-05-09).

This code allows complete control over the color of an arbitrary number of LED strips with an arbitrary number of LEDs.  Each LED can be individually controlled, and LED strips can be chained together.
